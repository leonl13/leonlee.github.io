						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							As a big fan of film and movies, I was always intrigued as to what drove them to commercial
							success. For me personally, if it's a big name director
							who's films I've enjoyed in the past, like Nolan, Scorsese, or Tarantino, or if there are a
							lot of positive reviews about it. Generally speaking,
							I don't care for how much marketing was put into the movie, and I would have a negative
							connotation towards a movie if I was seeing a lot of their
							advertisements.
						</p>
						<p>
							Going in, I had a few assumptions:
						<ul>
							<li>Higher production budget would result in more funds for marketing, leading to more
								viewership and overall success.</li>
							<li>Bigger production companies would generally see more success, since their production
								budget would generally be higher.</li>
							<li>A big name director and their fame being attached could carry the movie.</li>
							<li>Commercial success did not necessarily correlate to a good IMDB user rating.</li>
							<li>There will be more user activity on IMDB for movies that were successful.</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<h2>Data</h2>
						<p>
							The data used for this project can be found and downloaded directly on Kaggle: <a
								href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies">here</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							The data includes information on over 6000 movies with attributes such as their production
							budget, their box office revenue, director, year of release, some IMDB information, and etc.
						</p>
						<h2>Project</h2>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/budgetvsgross.png"
								alt="Regression Plot of Production Budget vs Gross Revenue"></span>
						<p>
							There wasn't much cleaning needed to be done for the dataset, so it was mostly just dropping
							nulls, and changing some of the data types like budget
							which was displayed as a float into an integer. There was a bit of confusion with the year
							and the release date of the movie so I just opted to use
							the year on the release date and drop the rest entirely as to avoid any confusion.
						</p>
						<p>
							Afterwards, I used Seaborn to create a regression plot to compare between budget and gross,
							as shown on the right. Just from a quick glance, it does
							appear that production budget and gross revenue are closely correlated. It was necessary to
							further examine what other attributes could be in play.
						</p>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/corrmatrix.png"
								alt="Correlation Matrix of All Attributes"></span>
						<br />
						<p>
							I started by categorizing the non-numeric columns and assigning them with unique numeric
							identifiers so that the data from the other text-based
							attributes could be used in the correlation calculations. The result of that is the
							correlation matrix shown on the left.
						</p>
						<p>
							The heatmap shows several points of interest, notably it verified that the initial
							assumption of production budget and gross revenue had the highest
							correlation at 0.74. Compared to other attributes, these two were the most correlated, which
							going back to the initial assumptions, it was most likely
							the fact that a higher budget would both allow for a higher quality product and also more
							funds allocated towards marketing, overall resulting in
							a higher turnout rate.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is also worth noting that the only other pair of attributes with over 0.5 correlation is
							gross revenue and IMDB user votes at 0.61. While they are not
							as nearly as correlated as budget and gross, it is still able to confirm the initial
							assumption that there would be more user activity on IMDB for movies
							that were successful. I believe that there is a general tedency amongst people that they
							feel the need to be critical towards a movie, good or bad, especially
							since the movie was a blockbuster success. There will always be stronger opinion towards
							popular, successful movies over the lesser known ones. It is
							also important to note that, despite this, the actual IMDB rating, or score, was not at all
							related.
						</p>
						<p>
							In conclusion, most of the initial assumptions were correct. Production budget plays a
							significant role towards the box office success of a movie. In turn,
							these hits saw more users on IMDB giving their ratings of the movie, but none of these
							factors played a part in how the movie was actually rated. The surprise
							is that big production companies did not actually seem to be more successful, most likely
							due to the fact that they choose to splurge on bigger projects and
							much less on others that they don't see promise in. It also appears that the general public
							doesn't seem to care who the director was and their name alone was
							not a driving force to pump viewership and produce successful movies.
